The Array Toolkit extends functionality to Array Themes. It provides a portfolio custom post type, image gallery support, and social media widgets.

==Description==

**Array Portfolio Items**

If your theme supports portfolio items, the Toolkit adds a Portfolio custom post type. Once enabled, you will see a Portfolio Items menu item, which you can use to create your portfolio.
